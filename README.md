This Go application is a simple way to practice web programming and CSV file processing. Users can upload a CSV file and see real-time calculations based on the data they provide.

** To test it, users run the application with go run main.go, open their browser to http://localhost:8081, upload a sample CSV file (e.g., header1,header2\n10,20\n30,40\n50,60)**
